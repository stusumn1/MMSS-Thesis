"Resolution:"
""
"The Census has adjusted the number of reported weeks worked for teaching occupations known to chronically under-report the number of weeks worked in the census reference year (E131 - Secondary school teachers, E132 - Elementary school and kindergarten teachers, A323 - School principals and administrators of elementary and secondary education)."

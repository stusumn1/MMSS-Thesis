Notes:
"1","Statistics Canada is taking additional measures to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. Starting with the 2001 Census, some population counts are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.",
"2","These figures have not been subjected to random rounding. For more details, see ""About the Data"".",
"3","Refers to the age at last birthday (as of the census reference date, May 15, 2001).",
"4","Refers to two people of the opposite sex or of the same sex who live together as a couple, but who are not legally married to each other.",
"5","Refers to the legal conjugal status of a person.",
"6","Persons who have never married (including all persons less than 15 years of age) and persons whose marriage has been annulled and who have not remarried.",
"7","Persons whose husband or wife is living, unless the couple is separated or a divorce has been obtained.",
"8","Persons currently married, but who are no longer living with their spouse (for any reason other than illness or work) and have not obtained a divorce.",
"9","Persons who have obtained a legal divorce and who have not remarried.",
"10","Persons who have lost their spouse through death and who have not remarried.",
"11","In 2001, the category includes both opposite-sex and same-sex common-law couples.",
"12","For the 2001 Census, a change in the concept of census family has resulted in a higher number of lone-parent families compared to the number established by the 1996 Census. There is an apparent increase of approximately 10% in the number of lone-parent families between 1996 and 2001 due solely to the change in concept. For example, at the Canada level, figures show a 15.3% increase in lone-parent families from 1996 to 2001. The conceptual change has resulted in an increase of 10.1 percentage points, leaving a real increase of 5.2%. For information on the new census family concept, see the Special Note ""Changes to family concepts for the 2001 Census.""",
"13","Refers to couple family households with at least one child under 25 years of age.",

"Issue:"
""
"An error was detected with the ""Work Activity in 2000"" and the ""Weeks Worked in 2000"" variables.

"Resolution:"
""
"The Census has adjusted the number of reported weeks worked for teaching occupations known to chronically under-report the number of weeks worked in the census reference year (E131 - Secondary school teachers, E132 - Elementary school and kindergarten teachers, A323 - School principals and administrators of elementary and secondary education)."

"An error was detected with the ""Work Activity in 2000"" and the ""Weeks Worked in 2000"" variables.

"Resolution:"
""
"The Census has adjusted the number of reported weeks worked for teaching occupations known to chronically under-report the number of weeks worked in the census reference year (E131 - Secondary school teachers, E132 - Elementary school and kindergarten teachers, A323 - School principals and administrators of elementary and secondary education)."

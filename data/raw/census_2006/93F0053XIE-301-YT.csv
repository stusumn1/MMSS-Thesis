"These data represent 100% of the population based upon 2001 geographic legal areas. Users wishing to compare 2001 Census data with those of other censuses should take into account that the boundaries of geographic areas may change from one census to another.

"D Special Note: 2D On Reserve"
"Persons living on Indian reserves and Indian settlements, who were enumerated with the 2001 Census Form 2D questionnaire, were not asked the citizenship and immigration questions. Consequently, data are not shown for Indian reserves and Indian settlements at the lower geographic levels. These data, however, are included in the totals for larger geographic areas, such as census divisions and provinces."

"Revised Date: September 30, 2003"
""
"Issue:"
""
"An error was detected with the ""Work Activity in 2000"" and the ""Weeks Worked in 2000"" variables. The error became apparent when these variables were cross-tabulated with specific detailed occupational categories (i.e. E131 - Secondary school teachers, E132 - Elementary school and kindergarten Teachers, A323 - School principals and administrators of elementary and secondary education)."
""
"Resolution:"
""
"The Census has adjusted the number of reported weeks worked for teaching occupations known to chronically under-report the number of weeks worked in the census reference year (E131 - Secondary school teachers, E132 - Elementary school and kindergarten teachers, A323 - School principals and administrators of elementary and secondary education)."
